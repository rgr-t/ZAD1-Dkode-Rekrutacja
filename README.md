# backend + database practical task
- c# 
- .net 7
- dapper
- newtonsoft

# database
- named MyDatabase ready to publish
- 3 tables 
- few user type tables for procedures
- few procedures for merges and one for get

# backend
- 2 endpoints
- first Get endpoint download files, save them, read, map to classes, filter out with task conditions, create dtos and merge into database
- second Get endpoint uses supplier name to call procedure with it as parameter and get desired data
- code is not complicated and have simple comments step by step so it should be clear
   
(first get might take a while, as all files are over 200 mb and have a lot of records)
